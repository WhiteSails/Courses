        <span>pwd</span> outputs the name of the current working directory.
        <span>ls</span> lists all files and directories in the working directory.
        ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories

        Redirection

        The common redirection commands are:

        > redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.
        >> redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.
        < redirects standard input to a command.
        | redirects standard output of a command to another command.
        A number of other commands are powerful when combined with redirection commands:

        sort: sorts lines of text alphabetically.
        uniq: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.
        grep: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.
        grep -i enables the command to be case insensitive.
        grep -R searches all files in a directory and outputs filenames and lines containing matched results.
        grep -Rl searches all files in a directory and outputs only filenames with matched results.
        sed : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.
        Example: sed 's/snow/rain/g' forests.txt

       Nano
        The environment refers to the preferences and settings of the current user.
        The nano editor is a command line text editor used to configure the environment.
        ~/.bash_profile is where environment settings are stored. You can edit this file with nano.
        environment variables are variables that can be used across commands and programs and hold information about the environment.

        export VARIABLE="Value" sets and exports an environment variable.
        USER is the name of the current user.
        PS1 is the command prompt.
        HOME is the home directory. It is usually not customized.
        PATH returns a colon separated list of file paths. It is customized in advanced cases.
        env returns a list of environment variables.
